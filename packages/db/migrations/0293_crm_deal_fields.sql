-- Custom deal fields (P4-04, ADR-373).
--
-- A company's deals carried only a title, a value, an owner and an expected close date. Owners and
-- administrators can now define up to 50 fields of their own (text, number, date or yes/no), as
-- they do for contacts (0005, ADR-115), and members who may change deals fill them in. Definitions
-- are rows; a deal's values are a JSON object keyed by field key, checked against the field's type
-- by the service, as contacts' attributes are.
