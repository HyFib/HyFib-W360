# Security

Last updated 2026-09-26. This document lists implemented controls, the role/permission matrix and
security operations. It is not a compliance claim; see `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` for open risks and
`docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` for launch gates (including an independent security review).

## Implemented controls (verified locally)

| Area               | Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant isolation   | FORCE RLS on every tenant table; transaction-local context that fails closed; runtime roles without BYPASSRLS/superuser/ownership (start-up self check); column-level grants; SECURITY DEFINER entry points with pinned `search_path`; 54 integration tests incl. pool reuse and jobs.                                                |
| Authentication     | Email verification required; scrypt password hashing (Better Auth); minimum 12 characters; DB-backed rate limits (sign-in 5/min, sign-up 10/h, reset 5/h, 2FA 5/min per IP); sign-up enumeration protection; sessions stored server-side without cookie cache (immediate revocation); revoke other sessions on password change/reset. |
| MFA                | TOTP with 10 backup codes; required for owner, administrator and billing roles after `MFA_GRACE_PERIOD_HOURS` (default 72 h); optional company-wide requirement; platform staff must have MFA.                                                                                                                                        |
| Authorization      | Permission matrix below, enforced in domain services (server actions and pages), workers (`authorizeJob`) and PostgreSQL policies. Suspended companies lose outbound permissions. Only owners manage owners; last-owner protection is transactional.                                                                                  |
| Sessions & cookies | `w360` cookie prefix, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure in production; session lifetime 7 days, refreshed daily; step-up window 15 minutes (library `freshAge`).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| CSRF               | SameSite cookies, Next.js server-action Origin/Host verification, and our exact trusted-origin check for every action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Browser hardening  | Per-request nonce CSP with `strict-dynamic`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, HSTS (preload-ready), `X-Content-Type-Options`, strict referrer policy, COOP/CORP, restrictive Permissions-Policy, `Cache-Control: private, no-store` on app pages.                                                                                            |
| Secrets            | Loaded from environment populated by the secret manager; production start-up refuses placeholder values; AES-256-GCM keyring with key ids, AAD binding and rotation support; logger redaction.                                                                                                                                        |
| Audit              | Append-only company audit log and platform audit log (privileges + trigger); security events for invalid job signatures, password resets and sign-up attempts on existing emails.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Platform access    | Separate platform role without BYPASSRLS; customer data only through reasoned, scoped, ≤8 h support grants visible to the company; no impersonation.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Supply chain       | Exact pins + lockfile, pnpm minimum release age, explicit install-script allowlist, `pnpm audit` and gitleaks in CI, GitHub Actions pinned by SHA, Trivy image scanning, Dependabot.                                                                                                                                                  |

## Permission matrix

Generated from `packages/domain/src/authz/permissions.ts` with `pnpm tsx scripts/permission-matrix.ts`.
Members can hold several roles; effective permissions are the union, minus permissions blocked while
the company is suspended or while required MFA is overdue (only `tenant.read` and `members.read`
remain).

MFA required (after grace period): owner, admin, billing.

Platform roles (`ops.platform_admins`): `platform_owner` and `platform_operator`. Both require MFA;
all actions are audited; neither can read customer content without a support grant.

## Secret and key rotation

| Secret                                  | Rotation procedure                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `W360_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`                  | Add a new key id, make it primary (`W360_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY_ID`), deploy, run the re-encryption job (phase 2 adds provider tokens), remove the old key after `Keyring.needsRotation` finds no rows. |
| `W360_JOB_SIGNING_KEY`                  | Drain queues or deploy dual-key verification first (backlog item SEC-4); then rotate. Invalid-signature jobs are dropped and logged.                                                                    |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`                    | Rotating signs everyone out and invalidates encrypted TOTP secrets; plan with the library's multi-secret support (`secrets` option) before production.                                                  |
| Database role passwords                 | Rotate in the secret manager and PostgreSQL (`ALTER ROLE … PASSWORD`), rolling restart.                                                                                                                 |
| Provider secrets (Meta, Razorpay, SMTP) | Rotate at the provider, update the secret manager, rolling restart; webhook secrets support an overlap window where the provider allows it.                                                             |
