# Progress

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 3: campaigns and saved segments (P3-04)

Status: **implementation complete for campaigns and segments, production blocked** (campaign
sends are verified only against the test-only Graph stand-in; a real Meta app, app review and a
sandbox WABA with test recipients are external prerequisites; cost estimates need platform staff to
copy Meta's current rate cards, none ship with HyFib; the 10,000-recipient run happened locally, not
in staging). Reports (P3-05) are not built yet.

### Completed

- **Schema (migration 0006):** segments; campaigns (template, number, variable mapping, audience,
  wall-clock schedule, window, pacing, caps, approval, lifecycle, counters); campaign recipients (ids
  and outcomes only) and campaign history (append-only); `messages.campaign_id`; company campaign
  settings (approval, marketing frequency cap, estimate currency); platform rate cards (immutable
  once published, guarded by triggers); `ops.campaigns_due` (definer, app role only). **Found by the
  10,000-recipient test:** with statistics stale after a bulk import, the planner used the
  `(tenant_id, purpose, status)` consent index and the `(tenant_id, whatsapp_account_id, wa_id)`
  identity index for per-contact lookups, making the snapshot quadratic (6.4 s and 1.7 M buffer hits
  for 10,000 contacts, a statement timeout in the test). The migration drops that consent index and
  adds a per-contact identity index; the same query now takes about 0.1 s.
- **Segments:** tags, consent, typed custom fields, creation date (company time zone), source, recent
  inbound messages, calling code and campaign responses (retargeting), all/any, parameterised SQL,
  preview, version-checked edits, archive.
- **Campaigns:** draft editor with a live preview and a review panel; submission freezes the
  audience; optional four-eyes approval; scheduling in IANA time zones (gaps move forward, repeated
  times use the first occurrence); sending window; deadline; pacing; marketing frequency cap; message
  and estimated spending caps; pause/resume (resumer takes over); idempotent cancel; test sends to
  existing contacts through the normal consent checks; per-recipient outcomes, last-touch reply and
  opt-out attribution within 72 hours, results with explicit denominators, failure codes explained,
  formula-safe audited CSV export.
- **Runner:** `campaign.run` ticks under the campaign's row lock and a per-company advisory lock,
  re-check each recipient with fresh data and queue ordinary messages through the Phase 2 pipeline
  (batch insert of messages, intents and jobs); the send worker refuses messages of paused or
  cancelled campaigns; the messaging sweep re-signals lost ticks. **Found by tests:** automatic pauses
  for a spending or message cap first released the sends queued in the same tick; only authority,
  template and number problems release queued sends now.
- **Platform:** rate-card console (CSV in Meta's layout, publish, withdraw with a reason; platform
  audit log).
- **Web:** Campaigns (list, new, draft/review, approval, controls, results, history, recipients,
  export), Contacts → Segments, Settings → Messaging → Campaigns, Platform → Meta rate cards. The
  Campaigns module is now available.

| `pnpm test` (unit)                                           | 90 passed (adds time zones and daylight saving, sending windows, variable mapping, cost arithmetic and prefixes, rate-card CSV)                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `pnpm test:integration` (PostgreSQL 18.x)                    | 153 passed: campaigns 16 (segments, lifecycle and attribution, live re-checks, test sends, cancel races, approval, pause/resume, launcher losing permission, schedules and windows, frequency cap, spending and message caps, isolation, 10,000 recipients), isolation 45, plus the earlier suites |
| `pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium --project=mobile-chromium` | 26 passed (13 tests × 2), including a campaign drafted, reviewed, started, queued by the worker, sent to the Graph stand-in, delivery counted, recipients and export                                                                                                                               |

10,000-recipient run (local, one machine, PostgreSQL 18 in Docker): snapshot 629 ms; 21 runner ticks
queued all 10,000 messages in 7.0 s. Real sending is paced by the per-number rate (default 20 per
second, about 8.5 minutes for 10,000) and by Meta's limits; that part was not measured.

### Known gaps (tracked in BACKLOG.md)

Reports (P3-05); the 10,000-recipient run in staging with real dispatch; per-recipient time zones;
A/B variants; reading the number's messaging tier from Meta; campaign sends through the public API;
media-header templates.

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 3: contacts, consent and templates

Status: **implementation complete for contacts, consent and templates, production blocked**
(template submission, sync and sends are verified only against the test-only Graph stand-in; a real
Meta app with `whatsapp_business_management`, app review and a sandbox WABA are external
prerequisites; Meta's opt-in guidance (M-131) and per-market consent law still need review).
Campaigns and reports (P3-04, P3-05) are not built.

### Completed

- **Schema (migration 0005):** contact email, typed custom values, source and erasure time; one
  contact per number (unique index); tags, custom field definitions, import runs; append-only
  consent events with trigger-maintained state (definer trigger); suppression list; company
  messaging settings; message templates with status history; template sync bookkeeping per WABA;
  `messages.template_id`; `app.erase_contact` and `ops.template_sync_due` (definer, app role only);
  a status-history guard that lets only the erasure function clear recipient ids. Found by the new
  tests: PostgreSQL regular expressions cap repetition counts at 255, so the template-name check is
  a character class plus a length check.
- **Contacts:** create, edit (numbers from WhatsApp are read-only), tags, typed custom fields,
  search and filters with keyset pages, CSV import (preview, explicit mapping, national or
  international numbers, never guessed; row errors by row number; consent only with an attestation
  and never over an opt-out), streaming formula-safe export, erasure. Inbound identities join the
  contact that already has the number, and the WhatsApp id Meta returns on a template send becomes
  an identity.
- **Consent:** keyword opt-outs/opt-ins from inbound text, quick-reply and interactive replies
  (company-configurable lists), member-recorded consent with a note, import consent, Meta 131050
  opt-outs, erasure opt-outs. Opt-outs win ties and the one-second uncertainty of Meta timestamps
  (found by a test in which a STOP sent in the same second as an agent's opt-in lost).
- **Templates:** editor with live preview and local validation; write-ahead submission; sync from
  the paged Graph listing (default-fields fallback), adoption of lost create responses and of
  templates made in WhatsApp Manager, failure of submissions Meta never received; deletion; template
  webhooks as sync signals through verified WABA bindings; per-minute sweep.
- **Template sends:** from a contact page (utility: inbox or campaign permission; marketing:
  campaign permission) and from the inbox when the 24-hour window has closed; consent, suppression
  and template approval re-checked right before dispatch; 132015/132016 mark the template paused or
  disabled; 131050 records an opt-out.
- **Web:** Contacts (list, add, detail, import, export), Templates (list per account with refresh,
  editor, detail with history), Settings → Messaging (keywords, marketing opt-in requirement,
  suppression list, custom fields); the inbox renders template messages and offers templates when
  the window is closed. Contacts and Templates modules are now available.

| `pnpm test:integration` (PostgreSQL 18.x)                    | 136 passed: contacts/consent/erasure 13, templates 12, isolation 44 (new function-privilege assertions), messaging 21, billing 30, jobs/email 14, services 2 |
| `pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium --project=mobile-chromium` | 24 passed (12 tests × 2), including contact creation, consent, CSV import/export and a template drafted, submitted, approved, synced and sent from the inbox |

Firefox and WebKit are not installed in this sandbox; they run in CI. Meta traffic in these tests
comes from the test-only Graph stand-in (`tests/support/graph-stand-in.ts`); no template has been
submitted to the real Graph API.

### Known gaps (tracked in BACKLOG.md)

Campaigns and saved segments (P3-04), reports (P3-05), safe contact merge (H-019), number masking
(W-044), media headers and other template types, URL buttons with variables (example format
unconfirmed, M-151), editing approved templates, sandbox verification of template submission, sync
fields (`rejected_reason`, `quality_score`) and template webhook payloads.

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 5 financial core (section 8A)

Status: **implementation complete for the wallet, top-up and auto-recharge slice, production
blocked** (Razorpay merchant activation, Recurring Payments for card mandates and a sandbox run are
external prerequisites; no request has reached the real Razorpay API; GST treatment of service
credit needs tax review; subscriptions are not built).

### Completed

- **Schema (migration 0004):** wallets, five ledger accounts per wallet, append-only ledger
  transactions and entries (balances by trigger, deferred balance check at commit), holds, Razorpay
  customers, card mandates (provider references and safe card metadata only), auto-recharge
  settings and attempts (one active attempt per wallet by partial unique index), top-ups. FORCE RLS
  everywhere, restrictive policies so runtime code can never mark a top-up paid or an attempt
  succeeded, support reads behind `billing.read` grants, and SECURITY DEFINER functions for every
  posting (credit, refund, dispute loss, hold/settle/release, auto-recharge decision) plus sweep
  and provider-id resolution functions.
- **Domain:** Razorpay client with classified results (retryable / permanent / auth / unknown) and
  constant-time signature checks; payment application from authoritative fetches only (payments,
  refunds, disputes, tokens); webhook receipt processing with quarantine; top-up reconciliation
  with backoff and expiry; the auto-recharge state machine with write-ahead unknown states and
  reconciliation by receipt / order payments; card mandate setup with the ₹1 authorisation refunded
  by idempotency key and abandoned tokens deleted; billing service for the web; owner/billing-role
  email notices; holds API for billable services.
- **Worker:** `billing.event-process`, `billing.auto-recharge` (check or advance), and a per-minute
  `ops.billing-sweep` (stale receipts, reconciliation, candidates, expired holds).
- **Web:** `/api/webhooks/razorpay`; Billing page (balance, add credit through Standard Checkout,
  card mandate, auto-recharge settings and attempts, payments, credit history) with the Razorpay
  CSP, COOP and Permissions-Policy scoped to that page. Found by the new e2e test: a CSP belongs to
  the loaded document, so provider pages (Billing, Channels) are now full page loads and reload
  once if reached by client-side navigation.
- **CI fix (0366b00):** WebKit e2e failed because input typed before hydration was reset by
  react-hook-form (and a pre-hydration click would have submitted the form natively). Client forms
  and click-handler buttons are disabled until hydration; regression test added. All 8 CI checks
  green on `0366b00`.

| `pnpm test` (unit)                                           | 49 passed (adds Razorpay signatures, client classification, Razorpay config)                               |
| `pnpm test:integration` (PostgreSQL 18.x)                    | 111 passed: billing 30, isolation 44, messaging 21, jobs/email 14, services 2                              |
| `pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium --project=mobile-chromium` | 20 passed (10 tests × 2), including a card top-up through the billing page and the signed Razorpay webhook |

Razorpay traffic in these tests comes from a test-only stand-in (`tests/support/razorpay-stand-in.ts`);
in the e2e run Playwright replaces `checkout.js` inside the test browser only. The configuration
refuses a non-official Razorpay origin outside `APP_ENV=local|test` and live keys outside
production.

### Known gaps (tracked in BACKLOG.md)

Plans and subscriptions (P5-01), statements, receipts and GST invoices, refunds initiated from the
platform console, step-up re-authentication for payment settings, Razorpay sandbox verification of
every flow and of the Checkout CSP, billable services that use holds (phase 6).

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 2 messaging slice

Status: **implementation complete for the phase 2 slice, production blocked** (Meta app, business
verification, app review and Embedded Signup configuration are external prerequisites; no message
has been exchanged with the real WhatsApp Cloud API).

### Completed

- **Schema (migration 0003):** WhatsApp accounts and numbers, onboarding sessions, contacts with
  per-WABA identities (BSUID first, phone optional), conversations (optimistic versions), notes,
  messages, immutable status history, send intents, media metadata, company event log (xid8
  cursors, NOTIFY hint), provider asset bindings, encrypted webhook receipts, quarantine, token
  buckets, retention functions. FORCE RLS and composite FKs on every tenant table; definer functions
  granted before ownership transfer.
- **Hardening (migration 0002, from review):** membership directories behind `members.read` support
  grants; platform seat counts and owner lookup through narrow definer functions; PUBLIC execute
  removed from every function (it had been granted by PostgreSQL's global default), with a
  structural test.
- **Domain:** webhook signature verification (current + previous secret), durable receipts,
  idempotent ingestion with quarantine and monotonic statuses, outbound send state machine
  (retries with jitter, per-number token bucket and fairness groups, unknown outcomes never resent
  automatically, manual resolution, cancellation on suspension or sender removal), Embedded Signup
  onboarding with server-side verification, resumable setup jobs, inbox service (visibility,
  assignment and status with row locks and versions, notes, read state), live-update event log with
  visibility filtering, retention.
- **Worker:** `webhook.process`, `message.send` (re-signals at `retryAt` in the number's group),
  `channel.onboard`, and a per-minute messaging sweep (lost signals, dead workers, retention).
- **Web:** `/api/webhooks/meta` (handshake, streaming 4 MB cap, signature, receipt before 200),
  `/api/c/{slug}/events` (SSE with replay, 30 s re-validation, polling mode), Inbox (views, thread,
  composer with per-member-and-company drafts and idempotency keys, window indicator, assignment,
  resolve/reopen, notes, unknown-outcome decisions, live updates), Settings → Channels (Embedded
  Signup, setup status, retry, disconnect) with Facebook CSP/COOP scoped to that page.
- **CI fixes:** WebKit dropped `Secure` cookies on loopback http (cookie security now follows the
  https origin; staging/production refuse non-https in any build mode); runtime images no longer
  ship npm/corepack/yarn (HIGH CVEs in npm's bundled dependencies); reviewed gitleaks false positive
  recorded. All 8 CI checks green on `e01bc26`.

Meta traffic in these tests comes from a test-only Graph API stand-in (`tests/support/`), which the
configuration refuses outside `APP_ENV=local|test`. Firefox and WebKit run in CI.

### Known gaps (tracked in BACKLOG.md)

Media download and storage, templates and template sends, message search, token health checks,
platform quarantine screen, messaging-limit display, collision warnings, Meta-side deregistration.

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 0 and Phase 1 vertical slice

### Completed

- **Phase 0:** repository assessment (empty repository: README + LICENSE only); toolchain research
  and pinning (ADR-002); research files for the WATI benchmark (164 capabilities), Meta WhatsApp
  platform (148 claims, Graph API v26.0) and Razorpay/RBI (105 claims) under
  `docs/research/`; dated feature matrix with truthful status (`docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md`, generated);
  architecture, decisions, threat model, security, backlog, Meta setup, deployment, runbooks,
  retention, release checklist.
- **Phase 1:**
  - PostgreSQL roles (owner/app/auth/platform/definer), schemas `app`/`auth`/`ops`, FORCE RLS,
    column grants, SECURITY DEFINER entry points (create company, invitation preview/accept,
    last-owner guard, tenant status, account recovery), append-only audit tables.
  - Forward-only migration runner with checksums and pg-boss installation/queue declaration.
  - Better Auth identity (verified email required, TOTP 2FA, DB sessions, DB rate limits,
    enumeration protection).
  - Domain services: tenant context resolution, permission matrix, tenancy (companies, members,
    invitations, audit), platform administration, job signing/authorization, email outbox/delivery.
  - Web: sign-up/in, verification, reset, two-factor, onboarding, invitations, company overview,
    settings (general, members, security, audit log, modules), account (profile, 2FA, password,
    sessions), platform area (companies, suspension, support grants, MFA recovery); CSP nonces and
    security headers.
  - Worker: email delivery, outbox sweeper schedule, health probes, graceful shutdown.
  - Docker images (web, worker+migrate), compose dev stack, CI workflows (quality, integration on
    PG 17/18, build, e2e on Chromium/Firefox/WebKit/mobile, security, containers), Dependabot.

Firefox and WebKit e2e runs happen in CI (browsers are not installed in this sandbox).

First CI run on PR #1 (commit `d9687b7`, 2026-09-26): lint/types/unit, integration on PostgreSQL 17
and 18, and the web/worker build passed; e2e passed on Chromium, Firefox and mobile but failed on
WebKit; both container scans and the secret scan failed. Root causes and fixes:

- WebKit drops `Secure` cookies on `http://localhost`, and the auth cookies were marked secure
  whenever `NODE_ENV=production` (CI runs `next start` over loopback http). Cookie security now
  follows the https origin, and staging/production refuse non-https origins in any build mode.
- Trivy flagged HIGH CVEs in the npm copy bundled with the Node base image (`brace-expansion`,
  `ip-address`, `tar`). The runtime images no longer ship npm, npx, corepack or yarn; local Trivy
  0.74.0 scans of both images report no HIGH/CRITICAL fixed vulnerabilities.
- gitleaks matched an empty `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=` in `.env.example` together with the
  next line (false positive; no value was committed). The fingerprint is recorded in
  `.gitleaksignore` and the variables are now separated by a comment.

Review round 1 (Codex on `d9687b7`), fixed in the following commit:

- Platform staff read company membership directories only through a `members.read` support grant;
  the console uses aggregate seat counts and an owners-only lookup (definer functions, platform
  administrators only). The company page loads by id instead of searching the newest 200.
- Support-access revocation is mirrored into the company audit log.
- Invitation issuance takes a per-company transaction lock, so the daily quota holds under
  concurrency (integration test: six concurrent requests at 99/100 yield exactly one invitation).
- Client IPs are resolved from `X-Forwarded-For` right-to-left past `TRUSTED_PROXIES` and validated
  with Node's IP parser; malformed values are dropped instead of failing the audited transaction.
- Found while testing: every `app`/`ops` function was executable by PUBLIC (a per-schema default
  cannot revoke the global default), and grants issued after transferring functions to
  `w360_definer` were no-ops. Migration `0002_platform_access_hardening` revokes PUBLIC, sets the
  global default for the migration role and re-grants as the owner; a structural test now fails if
  any function is executable by PUBLIC.

### Running end-to-end tests locally

```bash
bash scripts/local-db.sh up && docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d mailpit
set -a; . ./.env; set +a; export APP_ENV=test
pnpm db:migrate && pnpm build
(cd apps/web && npx next start --port 3000 &) ; (cd apps/worker && NODE_ENV=production node dist/main.js &)
E2E_DATABASE_URL_AUTH=$DATABASE_URL_AUTH pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium
```

The inbox e2e test needs the test-only Meta settings in `.env` (web and worker):
`META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET` (any random value), `META_GRAPH_API_VERSION=v26.0`,
`META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `META_GRAPH_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4010` and `E2E_GRAPH_PORT=4010`;
Playwright's global setup starts the Graph stand-in on that port. Without them the test is skipped.
The billing e2e test similarly needs `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_…`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` and
`RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (random values), `RAZORPAY_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4020` and
`E2E_RAZORPAY_PORT=4020`.

### Blockers (external)

- Network policy of this build environment blocked `wati.io`, `developers.facebook.com`,
  `business.whatsapp.com` and `razorpay.com`; research relies on search summaries and official GitHub
  sources and must be re-verified.
- Meta: business verification, Tech Provider app review, Embedded Signup configuration.
- Razorpay: merchant activation (Orders, Subscriptions, Recurring Payments card mandates).
- Owner decisions: SMTP provider and sending domain, hosting provider/region, legal entity for billing.

### Next task

Phase 3 foundations that unblock real usage: contacts with consent provenance and suppression,
message templates (drafts, Meta submission, approval sync) and template sends, then campaigns with
send-time consent checks. In parallel: phase 2 follow-ups (media storage, token health, quarantine
screen) and P5-01 plans and subscriptions.
